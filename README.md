This project involved replicating the Level Ground Mixed Martial Arts homepage. The goal was to rebuild the layout and style of an existing nonprofit website, focusing on accurately reproducing its structure, color scheme, typography, and responsive behavior. The project emphasized the ability to implement a responsive layout that adapts to mobile screen sizes.

I used HTML and CSS tools.

I gained experience with float-based layouts and box-model adjustments (margin, padding, borders). I improved understanding of how to rearrange layouts and resize elements for smaller screens and practiced identifying layout issues caused by floats and margins.
